# README

This repo is set up to test various styles, tools, extensions, and
formats that might be used in the NEST documentation.

The goal is to try out the look and feel in a small sphinx environment,
iron out the kinks here, and then port it to the nest-simulator repo
if deemed cool enough.

The nest-simulator repo is big and takes time to build. Potential
issues may crop up that are not directly related to the development
of what is being directly tested and developed here.

This repo uses the same theme and css that nest-simulator uses.
But things like API and example generation are not currently
supported.
